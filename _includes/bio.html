  	<p><img alt="pic" style="width:180px;float:right;margin-left:20px;margin-right:20px;" src="/assets/img/me.png">My interests encompass a range of interrelated fields, including Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and Software Engineering. These areas have captured my attention because of their potential to solve complex problems and improve our lives in a variety of ways. My background as a Software Engineer with four years of professional experience at DXC Technology and my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Data Science and Machine Learning from the University of Southern California have further fueled my passion in these fields. </p>
  	<p> Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that uses algorithms to enable computers to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects that utilized this field, such as predicting whether a person is a potential customer for opening a long-term deposit account in a bank through the use of SVM, Perceptron, Probabilistic Minimum Risk Bayes classifier, and Deep Neural Networks. I am fascinated by the potential of these algorithms to make predictions and automate decision-making processes, as well as the ethical and societal implications of their use. </p>
    <p> Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, is a broader field that encompasses Machine Learning and other areas, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. I am interested in exploring how AI can enhance human capabilities and improve our lives, as well as how it can be used to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.</p>
    <p> Statistics plays an important role in understanding and interpreting data. I am eager to learn more about advanced statistical methods such as Bayesian statistics and causal inference, and how they can be used to answer complex questions.</p>
    <p> Software Engineering is crucial in bringing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications to life. I am interested in learning more about software development methodologies and best practices, as well as developing my own software projects to make AI applications more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
    <p> In conclusion, my interests in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, and Software Engineering stem from my desire to understand and contribute to the development of technologies that have the potential to improve our lives and solve complex problems. I have already gained extensive knowledge and experience in these fields through various projects and coursework, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in these fields to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
 <p>I am particularly interested in Exploring data which leads to creating probabilistic models for Bayesian Machine Learning. Creating insights and predictive models by using Machine learning is something I enjoy too. For full profile check out my linkedIn at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/">Ruchin Patel</a>.
